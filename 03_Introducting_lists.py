# What is list? A list is a collection of items in particular order. 
# List could include letters of the alphabets, the digit from 0-9, or name of all the people in your family.
# Because multiple items are in a list, so keeping the names plural is a good practice

# Square bracket [] indicate a list
# individual element in a list is separated by commas. 

bicycles = ["trek", "cannodale", "redline", "specialized"]
print(bicycles)
